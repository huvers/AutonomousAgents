Autonomous Agent Navigation via Casual Entropic Forces

Concepts from the paper "Casual Entropic Forces" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 168702 (2013)) are used to perform autonomous navigation in mazes, as well as to play checkers.

Monte Carlo is performed for k steps after choosing to turn left or right. The turn that leads to the largest number of acceptable outcomes in the future (or entropy), is chosen.
